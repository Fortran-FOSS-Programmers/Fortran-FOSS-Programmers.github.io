>  The Fortran FOSS Programmers group aims to aggregate *brave* Fortran programmers for sharing knowhow, for inspiring each other, and for developing (together) new exciting Fortran projects with love!

> Each member can help as he/she wants; it is not required that you write tons of SLOCs (source lines of code). Simply share your idea with us!
